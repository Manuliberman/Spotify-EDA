# Spotify Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on a Spotify dataset. The purpose of this project is to analyze various variables and gain insights into song duration, danceability, and popularity. Furthermore, as a music fan, it has always been a motivation of mine to know if it is possible to predict what will be the popularity of a certain song given specific attributes. This is the main motivation for the implementation of the Machine Learning model in the last section.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of Spotify audio features for a collection of songs. It includes information on song metrics such as duration, danceability, tempo, popularity, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, energy, loudness, valence, key and speechiness. It also includes descriptive variables such as the name of the song, artist, id and year the song was released.

## Analysis
The EDA project focuses on three key variables:

*Song Duration*: The distribution of the song duration variable is analyzed to understand its characteristics. Additionally, the variation of song duration over time is explored to identify any trends or patterns.

*Danceability*: A list of the 20 most danceable songs is generated based on the danceability variable. The relative standard deviation of the 'tempo' variable is investigated to identify any interesting observations or insights.

*Popularity*: The correlation between popularity and other variables is examined to determine any relationships. Furthermore, Machine Learning models are applied to predict the popularity of a song based on the available dataset.

Furthermore, this project attempts to create a Machine Learning model which attempts to predict the popularity of a song using the numerical features contained in the dataset.
